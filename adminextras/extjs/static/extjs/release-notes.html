                    <li>Implement endDrag method in DragTracker</li>
                    <li>Button now has a overMenuTrigger flag</li>
                    <li>Rename pressClass to pressedCls and add check before cls removal in ClickRepeater</li>
                    <li>Remove unecessary onDisable/onEnable override in menu.Item and Button</li>
                    <li>Rename disabledClass to disableCls in Component</li>
                    <li>Removed the positionAnimation property since it is no longer necessary with the Component.animate API</li>
                    <li>Removed reverse parameter from keyframed animations</li>
                    <li>The pause and running flags now maintained within keyframed animations (Animator.js)</li>
                    <li>Update the RowSelectionModel constructor so we can add more useful contextual information to the event</li>
                    <li>Menu now extends Panel to support docking</li>
                    <li>Add isOnLeftEdge and isOnRightEdge for Grid Header events</li>
                    <li>Grid HeaderContainer dragging property now defaults to false</li>
                    <li>Animate's hasActiveFx will now return the current fx.Anim object if there is one or return false if none are active</li>
                    <li>Renamed tab reorderer plugin to TabReorderer</li>
                    <li>Renamed MenuMgr to MenuManager</li>
                    <li>Remove Ext.isForcedBorderBox property</li>
                    <li>Remove the experimental enableForcedBoxModel property</li>
                    <li>Ext.isBorderBox logic now reflects the use of css box model</li>
                    <li>CheckboxGroup/RadioGroup setValue method has been simplified; it now only accepts a single format of an object of name-value mappings. The old additional formats will be added to the legacy compatibility layer as an override</li>
                    <li>CheckboxGroup/RadioGroup getValue method has been changed to return an object of similar format to what is accepted by setValue for internal consistency. The old behavior has been moved to a new getChecked() method</li>
                    <li>The methods setRawValue, getRawValue, valueToRaw, and rawToValue have been moved out of Field and into BaseField; this is to make the main Field interface simpler and more easily implemented on components which do not have the concept of an underlying "raw value" like CheckboxGroup</li>
                    <li>Field now has a areValuesEqual method which compares values returned from getValue() for logical equality, and is used anywhere a comparison is necessary such as checkChanges() and isDirty(). The base implementation is a simple string comparison, but can be overridden by fields with more complex values</li>
                    <li>Field now has a resetOriginalValue method which is called by the form when trackResetOnLoad=true instead of setting originalValue directly, this allows the behavior to be overridden by field subclasses</li>
                    <li>Field's getSubmitValue method has been changed to a more powerful getSubmitData method, which returns a mapping object of name-value pairs; this allows single fields to return multiple values under different names rather than being limited to a single name per field. The getSubmitValue method has been retained as a helper but moved down to BaseField</li>
                    <li>Introduced a batchChanges method on field as a utility for preventing excessive firing of change events in fields such as CheckboxGroup that have many sub-fields who may be updated as a batch</li>
                    <li>Basic's isValid method has been changed back to its old behavior where it iterates through all fields in the form and triggers error markings. A new hasInvalidField method has been added to retain the more efficient short-circuited validity checking and preventing error markings</li>
                </ul>
